The program outlined below was developed with the following objectives and content to rigorously assess the statistical similarity between real longitudinal data and synthetic longitudinal data.

The core elements and goals of this program are as follows:

To establish a technique for evaluating the statistical similarity between real longitudinal data and synthetic longitudinal data, utilizing a Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMEM) and Cohen's d as the key metrics.Estimation of Longitudinal Trajectories 
To consistently estimate the changes over time (longitudinal trajectories) within both the real and synthetic longitudinal datasets using the LMEM framework.
The LMEM allows for the simultaneous modeling of population-level trends (fixed effects) and subject-specific variations (random effects).
Validation of Model Parameters via Effect Size: To evaluate the difference between the fixed effects and random effects (specifically for the slope and intercept parameters) of the estimated LMEMs. 
This comparison is quantified using Cohen's d, a widely accepted measure of effect size.
The calculated Cohen's d values serve as the basis for rigorously assessing the statistical congruence between the real data and the synthetic data, thereby validating the synthetic data generation process.
